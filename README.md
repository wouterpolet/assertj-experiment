# AssertJ Performance Experiment

This experiment was created for the Software Architecture course at the TU Delft.
The essays in which it is used can be found at the [course website](https://desosa2022.netlify.app/projects/assertj/).

It includes small test suites for the hotspots of the [`assertj-core`](https://github.com/assertj/assertj-core) repository: `Maps`, `Iterables`, `Strings`, `Arrays`.
They are exercised using various sizes of these types to check the growth in time.
